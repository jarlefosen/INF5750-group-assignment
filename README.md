## Tools
* [NPM - Node Package Manager](http://nodejs.org/)
* Bower - Web package manager

## Linting

The project includes Javascript Linting (eslinting).
To run it you have to set up the project first (see below).

Then run `grunt eslint`

This might fail if grunt is not installed globally. `npm install -g grunt grunt-cli` will fix this.

If you only want to see linting for the files you were working on, try
setting up the commit hook below.

## Commit hooks

We can run JavaScript linting after each commit to indicate if you have
written anything wrong.

Just run `./link_hooks.sh` and it will do it's job!

It will check javascript files that you have edited.

## Setup

It is important that you have NPM intsalled before you run this app.
It is THE package manager for [Node JS](http://nodejs.org/)

And then run the following code.

```
$ npm install
```

This will install all tools that the project depends on. Including Bower.
There exists a script in package.json that installs all bower dependencies
when you either start the app or installs npm dependencies.

**Remember** to run `$ npm install` when package.json and/or bower.json is updated.

## Run in browser

To run the project in the browser, just start `$ npm start` and all
dependencies will be installed.

**Note** That any calls from the browser to the server most likely will be blocked due to CORS security.
