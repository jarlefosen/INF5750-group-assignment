## Setup

It is important that you have NPM intsalled before you run this app.
It is THE package manager for [Node JS](http://nodejs.org/)

And then run the following code.

```
$ npm install
```

This will install all tools that the project depends on. Including Bower.
There exists a script in package.json that installs all bower dependencies
when you either start the app or installs npm dependencies.

**Remember** to run `$ npm install` when package.json and/or bower.json is updated.
